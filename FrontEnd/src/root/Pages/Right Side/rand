Perfect — thank you for the clarification.

You're absolutely right: many real-time chat apps (like Telegram Web or WhatsApp Web) don’t use URL routing for each user. Instead, they keep everything on one page and use state to determine which chat is active.

So your app likely works like this:

Left side: list of users or chats.

Right side: shows messages based on the currently selected user stored in React state.

No route change happens when selecting a user.

✅ So... is it possible to switch to User B's chat on notification click?
Yes, it's 100% possible — but you need to make sure that:

The notification click triggers a state update.

That state tells your app to switch to User B’s chat.

🔧 How to implement it
Here’s the key idea:

Your app has some global state (React Context, Redux, Zustand, or even lifting state up) that tracks the current chat user.

When a notification is clicked, you dispatch an event or call a function to update that state with User B’s ID.

✅ Example Using React Context
Assume you have a ChatContext that holds:

js
Copy
Edit
const [selectedUserId, setSelectedUserId] = useState(null);
In your notification code:

js
Copy
Edit
const notifyUser = (senderId, senderName) => {
  if (Notification.permission === "granted") {
    const notification = new Notification(`New message from ${senderName}`, {
      body: "Click to view chat",
      icon: "/chat-icon.png"
    });

    notification.onclick = () => {
      window.focus();

      // Custom event to tell React to switch chat
      const event = new CustomEvent("switch-to-user", { detail: { userId: senderId } });
      window.dispatchEvent(event);
    };
  }
};
Then, in your React app (maybe in App.jsx or wherever your context/state is defined):

js
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  const handler = (e) => {
    const userId = e.detail.userId;
    setSelectedUserId(userId); // Now chat UI will show messages with this user
  };

  window.addEventListener("switch-to-user", handler);
  return () => window.removeEventListener("switch-to-user", handler);
}, []);
🧠 Key Points
This is very close to how desktop chat apps handle this.

You don't need URL changes — just listen to events and update state.

You can also use global state tools (Redux, Zustand, etc.) if preferred.
